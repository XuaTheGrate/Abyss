*..what in the world was that?*
<Cheerful Male Classmate> Hey! {ctx.author.display_name}!
$queuebgm "38 - Butterfly Kiss"$
<Cheerful Male Classmate> Snap out of it man, we are gonna be late for the plane!
Come on, let's get moving.
*Right, I'm already nearly late for our flight.*
# continues when you get on the plane
$breakpoint$
<Flight Attendant> Just in time! Please head this way.
<Eager Female Classmate> Japan here I come!
<Excited Male Classmate> This is so exciting!
<Happy Male Classmate> I've been looking forward to this for so long! It's finally happening!
<Timid Female Classmate> W-we are going to Shibuya right?
<Cheerful Male Classmate> Let's get on board and get the good seats eh?
Hey, you seem pretty out of it. Aren't you excited?
$choice "Hey, you seem pretty out of it. Aren't you excited?" "Of course I am." "Kind of..." "No, not really."
"Of course I am." "You really seem like something is on your mind."
"Kind of..." "Come on, it's Japan! This is the first time you've ever left this country. Show some spirit!"
"No, not really." "What so you'd rather have stayed here? Lighten up man."$
<Cheerful Male Classmate> Anyway, hurry up! Let's get the good seats.
*I know Ryuji has good intentions, but I just can't enjoy this.*
*Especially after whatever I just saw.*
<Ryuji> Let's go already!
*I guess I don't have a choice.*
<Speaker> Flight #47 will be leaving in 5 minutes.
$queuebgm "07 - Recollection & Foreboding"$
*Japan, huh.*
*I can't say I'm not excited. I've always wanted to leave this country.*
*I guess it was just something random.*
*Mom always chalked it up as something that's created by anxiety and I should ignore it.*
*...There's no use thinking about it I suppose.*
*The class has been wanting to go on this trip for 3 years.*
*It was supposed to be last year, but torrential rainfall caused our flight to be canceled.*
*I have 2 friends in this class at least, so it can't be all bad.*
*You've already met one of them, his name is Ryuji Sakomoto.*
*I've known him for a long time, he's a trustworthy guy.*
*He might be a little bit of an idiot at times, but he means well.*

<Jumpy Female Classmate> Nice choice of seating, Ryuji and {ctx.author.display_name}.
<Ryuji> Uwah! Futaba!? When did you get there?
<Futaba> I've been sitting here for a few minutes now. This class is so slow.
*The other is Futaba Sakura.*
*She's a junior and been in this class since only last year.*
*We met purely by poor seating arrangements and the three of us have been friends since.*
<Futaba> Hmm? What's with the blank face {ctx.author.display_name}?
$choice "Hmm? What's with the blank face {ctx.author.display_name}?" "It's nothing." "Just thinking about things."
"It's nothing." "<Futaba> When most people say that it's something serious."
"Just thinking about things." "<Futaba> Thinking is dangerous, so you should stop!"$
<Futaba> Be happy we finally get to leave this dump country!
<Ryuji> So cruel to the place you grew up in.
<Futaba> I can't help it I've always wanted to go overseas!
<Ryuji> Oh yea this is your first time overseas too.
I've never been to Japan though, so this is a first for me too.
*..?*
*A girl sat down a few seats away, but I don't recognize her.*
*I'm gonna feel bad if she's been in the class the whole time but I've never noticed.*
*She doesn't look particularly happy.*
<Ryuji> Ooh is that the kind of girl you like {ctx.author.display_name}?
*Annoyed, I averted my gaze and looked out the window.*
*It's raining again this year, but it's not nearly as bad as it was.*
<Futaba> Hope you don't get air-sick because this is gonna be one bumpy ride.
Hey, which mode of transportation do you prefer?
$choice "Hey, which mode of transportation do you prefer?" Car Boat Plane
Car "A safe, yet dangerous choice. Close to the ground but has the most victims."
Boat "I love the breeze of the ocean but I can't swim very well."
Plane "The fastest way to travel. Too bad I can't fly by myself."$
<Futaba> I prefer boats. I may not be able to swim but I can stay afloat long enough for a rescue boat.
<Ryuji> Assuming one comes for you.
<Futaba> Okay Ryuji, what's your preference?
<Ryuji> Me? I'd have to say cars.
I like a good drive around the countryside every once in a while.
<Futaba> Ooo a mature answer, that's unexpected.
<Ryuji> Hey what's that s'posed to mean!?
$queuebgm "60 - Alleycat"$
*...*
*..maybe I'm just not the biggest fan of travel at all.*
*I've never been away from my parents this much.*
*And here I am going on a trip away from them for a whole year.*
*I am excited, I've never been to a big city - let alone outside my home country.*
*I just wonder if everything will be alright.*
<Pilot> The plane will now be leaving. Please be seated and enjoy your flight.
*...it's not like me to be so pessimistic.*
*Maybe I'll just sleep the whole way.*
*I snuck at glance at the girl a few seats away.*
*She seems like she's asleep.*
*I look back out the window to see the runway speeding past underneath us.*
*Take off is imminent, and a new adventure will begin.*

*Where am I?*
<ajfb2> ...
*And who is that?*
<8vbjh> That is not important right now.
<fhf89> You remember what you were told, yes?
*What I was told..?*
$choice "What I was told..?" "I do." "Not really..."
"I do." "<k1nmb> Very good. Be sure not to forget."
"Not really..." "<k1nmb> Hmm, that may be troublesome in the future."$
<19jfa> Nevermind that now, your **true role** is about to begin.
<lakf8> I shall call you here again when you have harnessed your unique power.

<Futaba> There it is! Japan!
*...I was awoken by a loud shouting in my ear.*
<Ryuji> About time you woke up! We are about to land!
*Did I really sleep the entire flight?*
<Ryuji> Come on, get your stuff ready. We will be leaving any minute now.
Hey Futaba, what time is it in Japan right now?
<Futaba> I dunno, like 4?
<Ryuji> 4 what?
<Futaba> Look outside Einstein, is it dark?
*Meanwhile they continue to bicker away, I took another glance at the girl from earlier.*
*She seems like an ordinary girl, why am I so intrigued by her?*
<Ryuji> What's with the puzzled face {ctx.author.display_name}? Never seen her before?
$choice "What's with the puzzled face {ctx.author.display_name}? Never seen her before?" "I have." "It's nothing." "I don't recognize her."
"I have." "<Ryuji> Oh really? Mind telling me where you met her?"
"It's nothing." "<Ryuji> Ooh is that right? Nothing at all, huh?"
"I don't recognize her." "<Ryuji> She's been in the class since last year but she never attended much."$
<Pilot> Please strap yourself in as we begin our descent into **Shibuya Airport**.
<Futaba> Alright here we go!
*...*
*For the coming year, we will be staying at a campsite resort in sourthern Tokyo.*
*It's a great spot since Kirei High is just down the road.*
*Oh yea, even though this is an overseas trip, we are still students.*
*In fact, we will be transfer students at Kirei.*
